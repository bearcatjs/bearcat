{"name":"Bearcat","tagline":"a POJOs based application framework for node.js","body":"## Bearcat -- a POJOs based application framework\r\nBearcat is a POJOs based application framework which provides a lightweight container for writing simple, maintainable [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Bearcat provides an infrastructural backbone to manage business objects so that developers can focus on application-level business logic. Bearcat enables you to build applications from \"plain old javaScript object\"(POJO) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs.\r\n\r\n> ###Simple POJOs + Configuration metadatas = Elastic, maintainable system \r\n  \r\n![](http://bearcatnode.github.io/bearcat/images/bearcat-logo.png)\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bearcatnode/bearcat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bearcatnode/bearcat)\r\n\r\n * Homepage: <http://bearcatnode.github.io/bearcat/>\r\n * Mailing list: <https://groups.google.com/group/bearcatnode/>\r\n * Wiki: <https://github.com/bearcatnode/bearcat/wiki/>\r\n * Issues: <https://github.com/bearcatnode/bearcat/issues/>\r\n * Tags: nodejs, POJO, IoC, AOP, consistent configuration\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n### lightweight container\r\n\r\n* Dependency injection implementated Inversion of Control (IoC) to manage POJOs\r\n* AOP based declarative middleware services\r\n* Consistent development and configuration\r\n\r\n### Easy\r\n\r\n* Simple meta configuration and POJOs\r\n* Lightweight: high development efficiency based on node.js\r\n* Reuseable: POJOs can be used to any development environment\r\n* Invasive: there's no dependence on a container API\r\n* Modular: you just use only those parts that you need\r\n* One stop shop: no need for a dedicated Singleton or factory for every object etc\r\n\r\n### Powerful\r\n\r\n* Good reference materials: full [docs](https://github.com/bearcatnode/bearcat/wiki), many examples includes [web todo](https://github.com/bearcatnode/todo), [realtime app](https://github.com/bearcatnode/chatofpomelo-websocket)\r\n* well-tested: test cases [coverage](http://bearcatnode.github.io/bearcat/coverage.html) is over 95%\r\n\r\n### Extensible\r\n* Custom features: you can add custom codes to container\r\n\r\n## What is POJO ? \r\nPOJO is an acronym for Plain Old Java Object, you can refer to [POJO wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object). It is mostly used in Java Platform which is used to emphasize that a given object is an ordinary Java Object, not a special object.   \r\nIn Node, what is POJO ?  \r\nIt must be Plain Old JavaScript Object, which is simple, ordinary, and not anonymous.  \r\nTo be not anonymous, it must have Constructor function.  \r\nSo POJO can be like this:  \r\n```\r\nvar POJO = function() {\r\n\tthis.props = null;\r\n}\r\n\r\nPOJO.prototype.method = function() {\r\n\t\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = POJO;\r\n```  \r\n\r\n## Why should we use POJO ? \r\n* POJO is simple, everyone can write it  \r\n* POJO makes development consistently, all your codes is POJOs  \r\n* POJO makes it friendly to document  \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nRunning bearcat is quite simple, all you have to do is to write simple POJOs and simple configuration metadatas like context.json, after this, passing context.json paths to bearcat, and run it, then all your POJOs will be magicly turned into an elastic, maintainable system.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nvar Bearcat = require('bearcat');\r\nvar contextPath = require.resolve('./context.json');\r\n\r\nvar bearcat = Bearcat.createApp([contextPath]);\r\nbearcat.start(function(){\r\n   var helloBearcat = bearcat.getBean('helloBearcat'); // get bean\r\n   helloBearcat.hello(); // call the method\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nCodes written by simple POJOs and simple configuration metadatas can be run without Bearcat, however, in this case, you should have to do a lot of things by yourself, like handling dependency, configuration  \r\n\r\nmore bearcat apis can be refered to [bearcat-api](http://bearcatnode.github.io/bearcat/bearcat-api.html)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) fantasyni and other contributors\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
